# Quest-Seatbelt-Script
Simple Standalone FiveM Seatbelt Script.

# About The Script
This script will toggle the player's seatbelt on and off when they use the /seatbelt command or press the configured keybind. When the seatbelt is on, it will disable the ability to exit the vehicle using the 'F' key. A flashing seatbelt indicator will also appear on the screen if the seatbelt is not on. A message will be displayed in the player's chatbox to let them know when the seatbelt has been toggled.

You can customize the keybind by changing the seatbeltKey value in the config.lua file. If the seatbeltKey value is not present in the config.lua file, the script will default to using the 'F' key.
